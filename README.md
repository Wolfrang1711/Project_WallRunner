# Project_WallRunner
GTA Team Project

WallRunner is a simple game in which we control a hero, and our goal is to reach the boss room and defeat it. During the game, we will jump over walls and climb them too. Overcome all the difficulties and help the hero to defeat the boss.

Wall Runner introduces an unusual, but interesting idea, because the elements of the environment are three-dimensional, and the character and obstacles are made in 3D. Dynamic gameplay, interesting level layout and nice graphics will allow you to spend your free time in a pleasant way.
